# Ohai User Configuration

Provides a standard for passing configuration settings to Ohai to configure its behavior as well as that of plugins.

## Motivation

    As a Chef user,
    I want to easily configure Ohai,
    so that it behaves optimally on my infrastructure.

    As an Ohai user,
    I want Ohai to load configuration settings from my client.rb,
    so that it behaves the same as it does during a chef-client run.

## Current State

Previously Ohai has not had a configuration file. A small number of Ohai configuration settings do exist that can be specified in the Chef client 'client.rb' file, which are then passed to Ohai during a client run. For example, additional locations on the file system can be searched for plugins by adding paths to the `Ohai::Config[:plugin_path]` array. This file is only loaded by Chef and does not affect Ohai when being run on the command line nor any other programs loading Ohai as a library, causing inconsistent Ohai results.

## Specification


The `Ohai::Config` Ruby class will use the new ChefConfig library that is bundled with the Chef client. Configuration will be set in a configuration file using a `Mixlib::Config` config_context named 'ohai'. Here is an example 'client.rb' file that would configure both the client and Ohai.

```
log_level        :info
log_location     STDOUT
chef_server_url  "https://api.chef.io/organizations/oneofus"
ohai.plugin_path = "/etc/chef/ohai/plugins.local"
ohai.plugin[:hostname][:fqdn_using] = [ :hostname, :nis, :dns ]
```

Because at the top level (outside of a config_context) the `Ohai::Config` class will be the same as `ChefConfig` and `Chef::Config`, existing top level configuration options like `Ohai::Config[:disabled_plugins]` will be deprecated in favor of new settings within the config_context, i.e. `Ohai::Config.ohai.disabled_plugins`. Until support for those top-level settings is removed, their values will be copied as appropriate for backward compatibility.

For convenience, a config method will be added to the `Ohai` class to access `Ohai::Config.ohai`, allowing the use of `Ohai.config[:plugin_path]` instead of `Ohai::Config.ohai[:plugin_path]` throughout the code. All existing uses of `Ohai::Config` in Ohai will need to be updated accordingly.


Example accessing the disabled_plugins configuration setting:

```
Ohai::Config[:disabled_plugins] # Current pattern
Ohai::Config.ohai[:disabled_plugins] # Proposed pattern
Ohai.config[:disabled_plugins] # Proposed shortcut
```

### Configuration Files

When run from the command line, Ohai should load the workstation 'config.rb' and then the 'client.rb' files from the appropriate platform specific path, unless an alternate configuration file is provided as a command line argument. This provides similar behavior to knife which loads 'config.rb' and then 'knife.rb'. This facilitates reducing the number of separate configuration files to maintain for command line behavior.

When loaded as a library, Ohai must not load a configuration file and will expect to be provided any necessary configuration options. For example, when loaded by the Chef client, configuration values will be located in the 'client.rb' file, or the file passed to the Chef client as the configuration file. Using the same file for configuration simplifies configuration file creation during bootstrap for the client.

### Namespacing

To reduce the risk of built-in and custom plugins using the same configuration setting for conflicting purposes, it is recommended that all plugins prefix their configuration settings with `[:plugin]` and the snake-case name of the plugin consuming the setting, as set in the plugin itself. The exposed overlap is intended, to facilitate passing a configuration option to the same plugin for multiple platforms but only specifying it once.

For example, configuration file settings would look like:

```
ohai[:plugin][:memory][:unit] = "mb"
ohai[:plugin][:dmi][:all_ids] = true
ohai[:plugin][:ec2][:silly_magic_arp] = "de:ad:de:ad:de:ad"
ohai[:plugin][:platform][:amazon_is_amazon] = true
```

Settings would be read in code as:

```
Ohai.config[:plugin][:memory][:unit]
Ohai.config[:plugin][:dmi][:all_ids]
Ohai.config[:plugin][:ec2][:silly_magic_arp]
Ohai.config[:plugin][:platform][:amazon_is_amazon]
```

Note that the filename on disk does not always match the plugin name. In the case of the 'darwin/system_profiler.rb' file, the plugin name is 'SystemProfile', and the correct plugin namespace would be `Ohai::Config.ohai[:plugin][:system_profile]`.
